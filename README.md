# Arbovirus Risk Prediction Project

This project employs advanced machine learning to predict and evaluate arbovirus risks, including arbovirus, across multiple cities. By integrating weather data, temporal patterns, and robust predictive modeling, it delivers actionable insights to anticipate and mitigate potential outbreaks. Careful preprocessing ensures data quality and model reliability.

## Key Features

- **City-Level Risk Scoring**  
  Predictive categorization (Low, Medium, High) and feature importance analysis.

- **Time Series Forecasting**  
  Using Prophet for multi-city predictions and statistical validation to forecast potential outbreaks.

- **Machine Learning Techniques**  
  - Random Forest classification  
  - Mutual information-based feature selection  
  - Advanced feature engineering
